Summary:
Using a modern frontend framework of your choice for example: React, Vue, Svelte (preferred) or
Angular:

1. Build a todo list web application (example can be seen here: https://todomvc.com/examples/
   react/dist/ that has the basic ‘todo' functionality:
   • Remove todo, +
   • Mark as “done”, +
   • Remove tag “done” +
   • Add a colour to the todo, using a custom (or atleast styled) color picker opened in a modal. +

2. Show a side menu at all times, that contains the following functionality:
   • Mark all as resolved, +
   • Mark all as unresolved, +
   • Remove all todos, +
   • Add a todo +
3. Add filter selection by: selected colour, resolved, unresolved:
   • The filter options are generated by the already selected colours (if there are no coloured “todos”,
   no color filters can be selected.) +
   • On clicking a colour filter, display only the “todos” with the selected colour. When applying the
   “resolved” filter in only the “resolved” “todos”, etc.
   • Add a button to clear the filters.

Technical requirements:

1. Use a dummy API to get the “todos” list such as: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
   (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). Add the ability to preload the default list.
2. Persist the requested "todos" data, and mutate it using any state management system, such as:
   https://svelte.dev/docs#svelte_store. Keep in mind the requirement to refresh the data to the default
   state.
3. Set validations for the creation of a new “todo”. An empty title string should NOT be possible.
4. Use reactive values to update the interface.
5. Style either custom or by incorporating elements from flat design like https://material.io/design.
6. Split the code using self contained components.
